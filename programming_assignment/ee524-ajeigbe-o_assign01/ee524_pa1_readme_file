ee524 Programming 01 Assignment Readme File

Note: Each of the benchkmark folders has a bash script for single runs of the test.(flrun.sh, qsrun.sh,barun.sh and blrun.sh)

1. Run the runbenchmarks.sh script file first.
    The runbenchmarks.sh script is the file that automatically runs all already created benchmark scripts three times.
    The outputs are stored in the various benchmark folders.
    P.S: The clearcache.py is the bash script that was added to the benchmark bash script file to clear the cache between consecutive runs.

2. SCP the files to the local PC.
3. Run the python script named (ACA_PA1.ipynb). This script converts the bash outputs to a data frame which can be exported to CSV.
4. Run the R script named PA1.Rmd. This script does some data wrangling as per the assignment's request. Such as:
    a. Find the mean of the runs.
    b. Computing the values of each run per 1000 instructions.
    c. Plotting the bar plots
    d. Lastly, generating the final data points table.
