ee524 Programming 02 Assignment Readme File

Note: The bash script in each benchmark folder has been modified to take on five parameters ($1,$2,$3,$4,$5). 

1. For part 2, run the runner.sh script in the master folder located In the EE524_CPTS561_Part 3_CPI_Variations folder to get the misstates for L1 and L2 caches. The runner.sh script automatically runs all already created benchmark scripts, then greps the miss rates from the stats.txt file in m5out. The outputs are stored on the slog.txt 

2. Run the loop runner.sh script found in the masters folder of EE524_CPTS561_Part 2_Demand_misses folder to grep the demand misses of all the caches. The output is passed into the loopslog.txt

3. Run the python script named (ACA_PA2.ipynb). This script converts the bash outputs to a data frame which can be exported to CSV.

4. The other analysis was done in excel.
